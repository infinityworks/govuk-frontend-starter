The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) is responsible for enforcing the
Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility

we respond to your complaint,
[contact the Equality Advisory and Support Service (EASS)](https://www.equalityadvisoryservice.com/).

## Technical information about this website's accessibility

[Name of organisation] is committed to making its website accessible, in
accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications)
(No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.

## Compliance status

The website has been tested against the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
(WCAG) 2.2 AA standard.

[Select (a) only if all requirements of the technical specification are fully
met without exceptions for WCAG 2.2.]

(a) This website is fully compliant with the
[Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) AA
standard.

[Select (b) if most requirements of the technical specification are met, but
with some exceptions. This means not yet fully compliant and that the necessary
measures are to be taken in order to reach full compliance.]

(b) This website is partially compliant with the
[Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) AA
standard, due to [insert one of the following: ‘the non-compliances', ‘the
exemptions' or ‘the non-compliances and exemptions'] listed below.

[Select (c) if most requirements of the technical specification are not met.]

(c) This website is not compliant with the
[Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) AA
standard. The [insert one of the following: ‘non-compliances', ‘exemptions' or
‘non-compliances and exemptions'] are listed below.

## Non-accessible content

The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons.

### Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations

Some images do not have a text alternative, so people using a screen reader
cannot access the information. This fails WCAG 2.2 success criterion 1.1.1
(non-text content).

We plan to add text alternatives for all images by September 2022. When we
publish new content we'll make sure our use of images meets accessibility
standards.

### Disproportionate burden

#### Navigation and accessing information

There's no way to skip the repeated content in the page header (for example, a
‘skip to main content' option).

It's not always possible to change the device orientation from horizontal to
vertical without making it more difficult to view the content.

It's not possible for users to change text size without some of the content
overlapping.

We've assessed the cost of fixing the issues with navigation and accessing
information. We believe that doing so now would be a disproportionate burden
within the meaning of the accessibility regulations. We will make another
assessment when the supplier contract is up for renewal, likely to be in [rough
timing].

### Content that's not within the scope of the accessibility regulations

#### PDFs and other documents

The accessibility regulations do not require us to fix PDFs or other documents
published before 23 September 2018 if they're not essential to providing our
services. For example, we do not plan to fix [example of non-essential
document].

Any new PDFs or Word documents we publish will meet accessibility standards.

#### Live video

We do not plan to add captions to live video streams because live video is
exempt from meeting the accessibility regulations.
